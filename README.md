# coppeliaCommand
Once upon a college degree I was a part of a group project to make a multi-DOF robot arm. We chose to link together the simulation environment CoppeliaSim and ROBOTIS servos using ROS2. The development turnaround was blindingly fast, and there was little to no documentation produced. Maybe you'll find some value here, but I wont blame you if you don't!
